# ME3Explorer-XENON
This is a build of ME3Explorer (r681) that is intended to work a *bit* better on Xbox 360 XXX files. It is completely unsupported and has very limited functionality - it is designed for converting xbox assets to PC assets, not for modding xbox files.

The ME3Tweaks Fork of ME3Explorer (4.2 and above) have much better support for big endian platforms than this build does.
